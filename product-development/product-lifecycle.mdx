The **Product Development Lifecycle** (PDLC) is a series of steps that guide the development of a product from ideation to deployment. At Infynno Solutions LLP, we follow an **Agile Scrum** approach to ensure flexibility, continuous improvement, and collaboration with clients throughout the process.

## Phases of Product Development

### 1. **Discovery**

The Discovery phase is led by the **Leadership** team to ensure the project aligns with business goals and client expectations. This phase includes:

- Initial client meetings and project scoping
- Identifying project goals, target audience, and success metrics
- Researching competitive products and market needs
- Establishing timelines and resources needed
- Documenting the project requirements
- Setting up a project board in **Jira**
- Assigning roles and defining milestones

**Roles Involved**:

- **Leadership Team**: Conducts discovery, sets strategy, and defines goals.
- **Project Manager**: Oversees the planning and sets up Jira board for task tracking.

**Tools Used**:

- **Jira**: Project management and issue tracking
- **Slack**: Communication with clients and team
- **Zoom/Google Meet**: Video conferences for discussions

---

### 2. **Design**

Once the project requirements are defined, the design phase begins:

- Creating wireframes and mockups
- Iterating on designs based on internal feedback
- Sharing designs with the client for approval
- Preparing design prototypes and user flows

**Roles Involved**:

- **UI/UX Designers**: Create wireframes, prototypes, and final designs.
- **Project Manager**: Tracks design progress and client feedback in Jira.

**Tools Used**:

- **Figma**: For wireframes, prototypes, and visual designs
- **Slack**: Design collaboration and feedback
- **Zoom**: Design review meetings with clients
- **Jira**: Design task tracking

---

### 3. **Development**

After finalizing the design, development begins:

- Writing code based on the designs and requirements
- Code reviews and pair programming
- Implementing features and functionalities
- Setting up databases, APIs, and integrations as needed
- Continuous integration and testing throughout development
- Regular **scrum sprints** with 1-2 week cycles to track progress

**Roles Involved**:

- **Technical Leads**: Oversee development progress and ensure technical quality.
- **Software Engineers**: Implement features and functionalities.
- **QA Engineers**: Assist with quality checks and testing during development.
- **Project Manager**: Tracks sprint progress, monitors task completion, and manages time logs.

**Time Tracking**: Developers and engineers log time spent on tasks in **Jira**, and project managers review time logs for sprint progress.

**Tools Used**:

- **GitHub/Bitbucket**: Version control
- **Jira**: Task management, sprint tracking, and time tracking
- **Slack**: Team communication
- **Zoom**: Daily standups, sprint planning, and reviews
- **AWS/Digital Ocean**: For deployment and hosting

---

### 4. **Testing**

This phase ensures the product is working as expected:

- Performing functional testing, performance testing, and security testing
- Bug identification and fixing
- User acceptance testing (UAT) with clients
- Continuous feedback collection and necessary adjustments

**Roles Involved**:

- **QA Engineers**: Conduct tests to ensure functionality and performance.
- **Software Engineers**: Fix bugs and issues found during testing.
- **Project Manager**: Tracks testing progress and manages client feedback.

**Time Tracking**: QA Engineers log time spent on testing activities in **Jira**, and the Project Manager tracks overall testing progress.

**Tools Used**:

- **Jira**: Bug tracking and sprint management
- **Slack**: Communication between developers and QA
- **AWS/Digital Ocean**: Testing environment hosting

---

### 5. **Deployment**

After thorough testing, the product is ready for deployment:

- Setting up production environments and final deployment
- Monitoring the product post-deployment for issues
- Gathering feedback from clients and users
- Ensuring the product is stable and scaling as needed

**Roles Involved**:

- **DevOps Engineers**: Ensure the product is deployed smoothly to production.
- **Technical Leads**: Oversee deployment and monitor stability.
- **Project Manager**: Tracks deployment progress and ensures the clientâ€™s feedback is incorporated.

**Time Tracking**: DevOps engineers log deployment time and issues in **Jira**, and Project Managers track post-deployment monitoring tasks.

**Tools Used**:

- **AWS/Digital Ocean**: Hosting and deployment
- **Slack**: Post-deployment communication
- **Jira**: Tracking deployment tasks and bugs
- **Google Analytics/Monitoring Tools**: Monitoring performance

---

## Feedback Loops

- **Client Feedback**: Regular feedback is gathered from clients during each sprint. This is crucial to keep the product aligned with client expectations.
  - Feedback is collected through **emails** or **Slack** and is tracked in **Jira**.
  - After each sprint, a formal feedback session is scheduled with the client to review progress, discuss any changes, and set goals for the next sprint.
