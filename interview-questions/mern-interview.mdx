1\. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?

**Answer:**
`==` checks for value equality, allowing type coercion, while `===` checks for both value and type equality.

```javascript
console.log(5 == "5");  // true  (type coercion)
console.log(5 === "5"); // false (strict comparison)
```

2\. What is the output of the following?

```javascript
console.log([] + {});
console.log({} + []);
```

**Answer:**

```javascript
console.log([] + {}); // "[object Object]"
console.log({} + []); // 0 (in a browser) or "[object Object]" (in Node.js)
```

3\. Explain event loop in JavaScript.

**Answer:**
JavaScript uses an **event loop** to handle asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the **call stack** and **callback queue**:

* If the stack is empty, it moves tasks from the queue (like `setTimeout`, Promises, or API calls) into the stack for execution.

4\. What is the output of the following?

```javascript
console.log(1);
setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3));
console.log(4);
```
